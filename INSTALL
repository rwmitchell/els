1) Customize any of the following Makefile compiler macros to suit
   your preferences (if using GNU then no changes should be necessary):

	CC = gcc
	CPPFLAGS =
	CFLAGS = -O -Wall
	LD = $(CC)
	LDFLAGS =

2) Customize any of the following Makefile installation macros to suit
   your preferences:

	BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
	MANEXT = 1
	MANDIR = /usr/local/share/man/man$(MANEXT)

3) To build ELS using GNU cc, execute "make" without any arguments.  
   Other targets are also available for for certain OSes using vendor's
   unbundled (i.e. non-GNU) compilers:

	# MAKE DEFAULT TARGET:
	make clean	# Clean-out any residue from previous builds
	make		# Build for most OSes using GNU cc (i.e. gcc)

	# OTHER POSSIBLE TARGETS:
	make SunOS5-cc	# Build for SunOS5/Solaris2 using WorkShop/SunStudio cc
	make HPUX-cc	# Build for HPUX using vendor's unbundled cc
	make OSF1-cc	# Build for OSF1/DecUNIX using vendor's unbundled cc
	make ISC	# Build for ISC

   Executing "make" without any arguments will build ELS for:

	SunOS/Solaris, Linux, CYGWIN, FreeBSD, Darwin/MacOS-X,
	HPUX, OSF1/DigitalUnix, AIX, IRIX, SCO, ULTRIX, DYNIX/ptx

   NOTE: Executables compiled under SunOS5.5 will still run under SunOS5.4,
   as the ACL functions are handled at runtime.  In other words, if you use
   both SunOS5.4 and SunOS5.5, it is better to compile using SunOS5.5.

4) Once the build is complete you can install ELS under $(BINDIR) using:

	make install

# EOF.
